# Matlab_Ensemble
The Matlab code used for running experiments on a novel ensemble classifier

Experiment.m is the initialization file, where user-defined parameters can be modified.
Do_Fold.m is a subroutine used inside Experiment.m, which calls the rest of the matlab files, all of which are related to training, selecting and testing the classifiers in the ensemble.
